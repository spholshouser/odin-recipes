    <h3>Grammys Homeade Apple Pie</h3>
        <p>This apple pie recipe was my gandmas favorite desert dish to bake. Everytime
        my family and I went to Grandmas, she made her famous apple pie. We would all
        argue over who got the first slice, though it always ended up being my Grandpa. 
        Nothing brings families together like a desert dish, and what better dish than
        a classic apple pie.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
            Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and 
            brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>

            <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. 
            Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. 
            Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>

            <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
